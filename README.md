# Bubble Saga

A simple classic game focused on collecting bubbles.

This is an older project created using **Godot 3 Mono (C#)**.  
Originally, it was my very first project made in Godot, created mainly as a learning experience.

Over time, the code no longer reflects my current standards and may contain minor issues.  
Still, I felt it would be a shame to discard the project completely, so I restored it to a playable state and published it as an archived project.
